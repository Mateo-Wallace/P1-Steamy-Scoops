## Introduction:
     This is the firsrt project of the Bu10 Bois. It is the first project assigned in our UCF bootcamp. It is a collabration bewtween Andrew Gibbs, Mateo Wallace, Jose Leyva, Noel Stafford using the knowledge that we have been taught so far to showcase our skills in building this project. 

## Description:
    This is a project that was put together to utilize two API's in order to perform a certain task. In our case we are using a Steam API and a Youtube API in order search for a game title. After searching for the game title the project will also display things such as the platforms it is available on, price, reviews, and a pciture of what the game looks like for the viewer. We will then utilize the Youtube API to search for a trailer and tutorial video for the viewer so that they can have a better understanding of how the game works and what the gameplay will actually look like.

## Requirements:
    This project does not require anything. We have provided the needed API keys for the site to function properly. No extra modules are needed to run this.

## Installation:
    This project requires no neccessary steps for installation. It is ready to run out of the gate as long as the user has internet connection and a web browser. 

## Configuration:
    This project has no modifiable settings or a modifiable menu. There is no configuration by the user needed.
