# Steamy Scoops

## Description:
This is a project that was put together to utilize two API's in order to perform a certain task. In our case, we are using a Steam API and a Youtube API in order search for a game title. After searching for the game title the project will also display things such as the games title, description, price, poster, and link to buy it on Steam. We will then utilize the Youtube API to search for the latest news regarding the searched game.

This is the first project of the Bu10 Bois. A collabration bewtween Andrew Gibbs, Mateo Wallace, Jose Leyva , & Noel Stafford using the knowledge that we have been taught so far to showcase our skills in building this project.

Together we learned to:

- Use a Kanban Board to efficiently assign and list tasks as a group
- Use multiple API's to display related information
- Troubleshoot unforeseen error in an application completely of our own creation
- Style using Tailwind CSS
- Work on the same branch as others and complete merge and pull requests
